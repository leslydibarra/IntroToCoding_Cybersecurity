sheCodes Semester-Long Project 
Team : Intro To Coding: Cybersecurity

- Each member worked on their own personalized Password Manager 
- Before diving into the main project, we spent 2-3 weeks learning the basics of Python, RSA key encryption, and Wireshark.

  The Development Process
- Each member successfully created their own Personal Password Manager!
- Our UI/UX team developed a simple demo of what the website may look like using Figma.  We were able to implement one of our member's code.
- Combined both the UI/UX and the backend code using Visual Studio Code and Tkinter library to best show how the project works
